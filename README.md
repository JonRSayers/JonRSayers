- 👋 Hi, I’m @JonRSayers
- 👀 I’m interested in mechanistic enzymology, protein-ligand interactions, rational drug design & docking, vHTS
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ....as much as I can about early-stage drug discovery, structural biology and vHTS 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on mechanistic enzymology, protein-lignad interactions & docking, antimicrobial resistance - novel inhibitors. Also, if you have a use for g quantities of purified  nucleocapsid protein, - let me know.
